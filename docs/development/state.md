## Current status (2026-05-08)

- **Version:** `1.9.0` in `VERSION`, `src/version_str.cyr`, and
  `dist/vyakarana.cyr`. Full 1.x tag history in the CHANGELOG.
- **What 1.9.0 added:** two AGNOS-native grammars —
  **CYML and LLVM-IR**. Token counts: cyml 659, llvm_ir 1194 —
  zero errors on canonical samples. **No new scanner
  extensions needed.**
- **Self-hosting closed.** `build/vyk grammars/cyml.cyml`
  produces zero errors. The grammar file format vyakarana
  uses for its own definitions is now bundled as one of the
  bundled grammars. yukti config (`yukti.cyml`) and vidya
  content samples (`content/<topic>/*.cyml`) all benefit too.
- **First non-stand-in post-M3 corpus.** CYML's
  `tests/corpus/dependencies.cyml` is a real vidya snapshot
  (`content/cyrius/dependencies.cyml`, 233 lines) — not a
  hand-rolled `concept.<ext>` per ADR 0006. Demonstrates the
  reciprocal relationship that ADR 0001 set up: vidya
  becomes a corpus supplier when it has the matching content.
- **Sigil-in-`ident_start` pattern logged** — used 7 times now
  across the bundled set, all with the same shape:
  - `$` — Rust macros (1.1.0, ADR 0007), Zig builtins (1.2.0
    via `@`), PHP variables (1.4.0), Java/Kotlin/Swift
    compiler-generated names (1.3.0/1.3.0/1.4.0), GraphQL
    operation variables (1.6.0).
  - `@` — Java/Kotlin annotations (1.3.0), Zig builtins
    (1.2.0), Elixir module attributes (1.5.0), CSS at-rules
    (1.7.0), GraphQL directives (1.6.0).
  - `%` — Elixir struct/map literals (1.5.0), LLVM-IR locals
    (1.9.0).
  - `!` — LLVM-IR metadata refs (1.9.0).
  - `#` — CSS id selectors / hex colors (1.7.0).
  - `-` — CSS custom properties (`--var`, 1.7.0).
  - `.` — asm directives / labels (1.2.2 / 1.2.3).
  Each grammar adds the byte to `ident_start` (sometimes
  `ident_cont` too), then optionally adds a words-rule entry
  to promote the resulting ident to keyword when the name is
  reserved. Pattern is robust enough to plan around.
- **Test count:** 622/622 (was 599 at 1.8.0; added 23
  assertions across 2 new grammars).
- **Grammars:** 38 bundled (shell, toml, json, cyrius, rust,
  yaml, markdown, c, typescript, javascript, python, go, zig,
  asm_x86_64, asm_aarch64, java, kotlin, cpp, csharp, php,
  ruby, lua, swift, elixir, ocaml, haskell, sql, graphql,
  protobuf, html, xml, css, scss, dockerfile, makefile, ini,
  **cyml, llvm_ir**).
- **Toolchain pin:** `cyrius = "5.9.36"` in `cyrius.cyml`
  (unchanged since 1.0.3).
- **Build state: GREEN on cyrius 5.9.36.** `cyrius build`
  clean; `cyrius test tests/vyakarana.tcyr` 622/622;
  `sh scripts/smoke.sh build/vyk` reports M0+M1+M2+M3 passing
  at v1.9.0. `dist/vyakarana.cyr` regenerated.
- **Consumer pressure:** unchanged. Public `tokenize_source` /
  `tokenbuf` API is unchanged across 1.0.0 → 1.9.0. Grammar
  record stayed at 160 bytes since 1.6.0.

### Language line closed at 1.9.0

The original 1.x roadmap targeted seven language batches
(1.3 – 1.9). With 1.9.0 shipped, **all seven have landed**:
- 1.3.0 — JVM + C-family
- 1.4.0 — Scripting + mobile
- 1.5.0 — Functional tier
- 1.6.0 — Data / query / IDL
- 1.7.0 — Markup + styling
- 1.8.0 — DevOps + infrastructure
- 1.9.0 — AGNOS-native

That's 27 grammars added across the language batches, on top
of 11 starter grammars at v1.0.0. **38 bundled, all-clean** on
their canonical samples. The 1.x line continues with the pre-
2.0 prep waves (1.10–1.13).

### Stand-in corpora — replace when vidya ships

Per [ADR 0006](../adr/0006-standin-corpus-policy.md), eight
grammars (json, yaml, markdown, javascript, java, kotlin, cpp,
csharp, php, ruby, lua, swift) use hand-rolled
`tests/corpus/concept.<ext>` samples. Each is ~150–250 lines
following the lexer+parser theme. When vidya ships reference
samples for any of them, swap the stand-in for the vidya
snapshot and update the corpus README.

### Variable-length-delimiter shapes — collective ADR pending

Four grammars currently document variable-length terminator
forms as deferred:

- **Lua** `[==[ … ]==]` long brackets with `=` padding (1.4.0).
- **Ruby** `<<~HEREDOC … HEREDOC` heredocs (1.4.0).
- **PHP** `<<<EOT … EOT;` heredocs / nowdocs (1.4.0).
- **Swift** `#"…"#`, `##"…"##` raw strings (1.4.0).

The scanner has no variable-length-delimiter pair rule today;
these all share the same scanner shape gap. If a real corpus
forces one of them, expect a collective ADR + scanner extension
that handles all four uniformly.
- **Toolchain pin:** `cyrius = "5.9.36"` in `cyrius.cyml`
  (unchanged since 1.0.3).
- **Build state: GREEN on cyrius 5.9.36.** `cyrius build` clean;
  `cyrius test tests/vyakarana.tcyr` 431/431;
  `sh scripts/smoke.sh build/vyk` reports M0+M1+M2+M3 passing
  at v1.2.2. `dist/vyakarana.cyr` regenerated.
- **Consumer pressure:** unchanged — owl's M3b stays unblocked;
  the public `tokenize_source` / `tokenbuf` API is unaffected.

---

## Known cosmetic gaps (coverage holds; no `error` tokens)

Closed in 1.1.0:

- **Rust macro metavariables** — `$tok:fragment` now tokenizes as
  one `ident`. ADR 0007. Was: 79 errors per macro-heavy sample.
- **TOML triple-quoted strings** — `"""…"""` and `'''…'''` are
  rules now. ADR 0008. Was: 188 errors per content-heavy file.
- **UTF-8 outside strings + C block comments** — `unicode_ident`
  default flag + a `/* … */` pair rule in `c.cyml`. ADR 0009.
  Was: 8 errors per typical vidya C sample.

Still cosmetic-only and waiting on a future ADR:

- **Char literals** (`'x'`, `'\0'`) and byte-char-with-escape
  (`b'\n'`): Rust + C still split into op/body/op triples.
  Needs a `char_literal = true` default with 2-3 char lookahead.
- **F-string prefix**: `f"..."` → `ident(f) + string("...")` in
  Python. Same for r/b/rb/fr prefixes.
- **Block comments in Rust** — Rust's `/* */` is *nestable*, so
  the simple pair rule used for C won't work. Needs a nesting
  variant. Not triggered by the canonical sample.
- **Python INDENT/DEDENT**: structural tokens Python parsers want
  aren't emitted. Not needed for the tokenizer's correctness bar.

## Past audits

- [2026-04-23 — Pre-1.0 audit](../audit/2026-04-23-audit.md):
  0 CRITICAL / 0 HIGH / 0 MEDIUM-open (one MEDIUM fixed in-pass);
  5 LOW. FINDING-006 fixed in 1.0.1. See `SECURITY.md` for the
  living state of the audit findings.

Next scheduled audit: 1.2.x closeout (after the new-language
additions land).

## Next up — 1.10.0 (Pre-2.0 prep, wave 1)

Per the [roadmap](./roadmap.md), the language line is done and
we move into the pre-2.0 prep sequence (1.10 – 1.13). **The
1.10.0 cut bundles two pieces of external-coordination work
that benefit from the full 38-grammar set being in place**:

- **Theme-palette contract** (M4 non-breaking parts).
  Document the kind → palette slot mapping in
  `vyakarana-design-spec.md` and the architecture overview;
  owl's theme files reference the ten kinds by name (not by
  ad-hoc identifier); add `vyk --theme <name>` to the
  diagnostic CLI for grammar-author preview without running
  owl.
- **vidya reverse consumption** (M6). vidya adds
  `[deps.vyakarana]`; reference pages render code through
  vyakarana + a renderer. Reciprocal-relationship payoff that
  started with [ADR 0001](../adr/0001-corpus-sync-policy.md).

After 1.10.0:
- **1.11.0** — External integrations: LSP bridge, theme
  export, content-based language detection, grammar
  composition for fenced markdown code blocks (the `<style>`
  / `<script>` body routing that 1.7.0's HTML grammar
  documented as deferred).
- **1.12.0** — Fuzz + stress harness (M7 prep). Audit doc.
- **1.13.0** — RC polish: binary size, startup benchmarks,
  error messages, man page, AGNOS / Cyrius packaging.
- **2.0.0** — Streaming tokenizer (M5 carryover). The one
  scheduled break in the public API. Migration guide
  alongside.

The 2.x line stays reserved for breaking changes; after
2.0.0, the post-2.0 backlog (incremental retokenization,
regex rule type) reactivates if a real consumer forces it.

Each new grammar is a `grammars/<name>.cyml` plus a
`tests/corpus/<name>.<ext>` (vidya snapshot per
[ADR 0001](../adr/0001-corpus-sync-policy.md)) plus probe
assertions in `tests/vyakarana.tcyr`. The data-driven scanner
already covers the structural shapes; expect each addition to be
mostly grammar-file work unless a language forces a new rule
type (in which case a new ADR per the M2 scope of
[ADR 0005](../adr/0005-m2-rule-type-scope.md)).

**Out-of-scope follow-ups still on the books** (capture before
starting 1.2.0 so they don't drift away):

- Rust byte-char-literal-with-escape (`b'\n'`) — pre-existing
  gap, not addressed by ADR 0007. Likely solved with the same
  `char_literal` scanner default that the C/Rust char-literal
  gap is waiting on.
- Python f-string / r-string / b-string prefixes coalescing into
  the string token. Documented gap; defer until a corpus or a
  consumer asks for it.
- Float literals + datetime literals in TOML
  ([ADR 0008](../adr/0008-toml-triple-quoted-strings.md)
  scoped them out).

Post-1.1 roadmap ([./roadmap.md](./roadmap.md) has the detail):

- **M4** — Theme-palette contract with owl. Shared palette header
  is the likely shape.
- **M5** — Streaming tokenizer (iterator API). Memory goes
  O(tokens in flight); enables `owl huge.log`.
- **M6** — vidya reverse consumption (vidya starts rendering its
  `content/lexing_and_parsing/` samples through vyakarana).
- **M7** — Polish + release candidate.

---

## Cross-repo coordination

- **owl** (`/home/macro/Repos/owl`) — its M3b was blocked on M1
  and can now add `[deps.vyakarana]` at the tag the user cuts.
  Do **not** sidestep with a path hack.
- **vidya** (`/home/macro/Repos/vidya`) — read before making
  corpus decisions. M6 will bring vidya on as a consumer; don't
  pre-negotiate that now.
- **cyrius** (`/home/macro/Repos/cyrius`) — toolchain. Pinned at
  `5.9.36` in `cyrius.cyml`. The 2026-05-07 `include`-graph
  regression filed against 5.9.32
  ([`./issues/2026-05-07-cyrius-include-graph-regression.md`](./issues/2026-05-07-cyrius-include-graph-regression.md))
  is resolved on 5.9.36. If you find another compiler bug, file
  it upstream; don't work around it in vyakarana.
