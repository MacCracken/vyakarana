## Current status (2026-05-08)

- **Version:** `1.7.0` in `VERSION`, `src/version_str.cyr`, and
  `dist/vyakarana.cyr`. Full 1.x tag history in the CHANGELOG.
- **What 1.7.0 added:** four markup + styling grammars in one
  cut — **HTML, XML, CSS, SCSS**. All four ship with hand-
  rolled stand-in corpora per
  [ADR 0006](../adr/0006-standin-corpus-policy.md). Token
  counts: html 249, xml 380, css 689, scss 526 — zero errors
  on canonical samples. **No new scanner extensions needed**;
  HTML's `<!-- -->` (4-byte / 3-byte) and XML's
  `<![CDATA[ … ]]>` (10-byte / 3-byte) are just multi-byte
  pair rules of the kind ADR 0008 introduced for TOML.
- **Three grammar-author findings worth recording (1.7.0):**
  - HTML doesn't keyword-list element names. HTML5 has hundreds
    of valid elements plus arbitrary custom-element names
    (`<my-component>`); a static keyword list would constantly
    drift. Same call as ADR 0004 for shell built-ins — themes
    handle the colouring by token text.
  - CSS custom properties (`--color-bg`) need `-` in
    `ident_start`, not just `ident_cont`. Without that, the
    leading `--` would tokenize as two operator hyphens.
  - HTML embedded `<style>` and `<script>` blocks tokenize
    as plain HTML at this layer. **Grammar composition** —
    routing inner content through CSS / JS grammars — is
    scheduled for 1.11.0 in the restructured roadmap. Until
    then, `body { color: #FF6600; }` inside a `<style>` block
    just produces structural HTML tokens, which is correct
    coverage but loses semantic colouring of the embedded
    content.
- **Test count:** 577/577 (was 544 at 1.6.0; added 33
  assertions across 4 new grammars).
- **Grammars:** 33 bundled (shell, toml, json, cyrius, rust,
  yaml, markdown, c, typescript, javascript, python, go, zig,
  asm_x86_64, asm_aarch64, java, kotlin, cpp, csharp, php,
  ruby, lua, swift, elixir, ocaml, haskell, sql, graphql,
  protobuf, **html, xml, css, scss**).
- **Toolchain pin:** `cyrius = "5.9.36"` in `cyrius.cyml`
  (unchanged since 1.0.3).
- **Build state: GREEN on cyrius 5.9.36.** `cyrius build`
  clean; `cyrius test tests/vyakarana.tcyr` 577/577;
  `sh scripts/smoke.sh build/vyk` reports M0+M1+M2+M3 passing
  at v1.7.0. `dist/vyakarana.cyr` regenerated.
- **Consumer pressure:** unchanged. Public `tokenize_source` /
  `tokenbuf` API is unchanged across 1.0.0 → 1.7.0. Grammar
  record stayed at 160 bytes since 1.6.0.

### Stand-in corpora — replace when vidya ships

Per [ADR 0006](../adr/0006-standin-corpus-policy.md), eight
grammars (json, yaml, markdown, javascript, java, kotlin, cpp,
csharp, php, ruby, lua, swift) use hand-rolled
`tests/corpus/concept.<ext>` samples. Each is ~150–250 lines
following the lexer+parser theme. When vidya ships reference
samples for any of them, swap the stand-in for the vidya
snapshot and update the corpus README.

### Variable-length-delimiter shapes — collective ADR pending

Four grammars currently document variable-length terminator
forms as deferred:

- **Lua** `[==[ … ]==]` long brackets with `=` padding (1.4.0).
- **Ruby** `<<~HEREDOC … HEREDOC` heredocs (1.4.0).
- **PHP** `<<<EOT … EOT;` heredocs / nowdocs (1.4.0).
- **Swift** `#"…"#`, `##"…"##` raw strings (1.4.0).

The scanner has no variable-length-delimiter pair rule today;
these all share the same scanner shape gap. If a real corpus
forces one of them, expect a collective ADR + scanner extension
that handles all four uniformly.
- **Toolchain pin:** `cyrius = "5.9.36"` in `cyrius.cyml`
  (unchanged since 1.0.3).
- **Build state: GREEN on cyrius 5.9.36.** `cyrius build` clean;
  `cyrius test tests/vyakarana.tcyr` 431/431;
  `sh scripts/smoke.sh build/vyk` reports M0+M1+M2+M3 passing
  at v1.2.2. `dist/vyakarana.cyr` regenerated.
- **Consumer pressure:** unchanged — owl's M3b stays unblocked;
  the public `tokenize_source` / `tokenbuf` API is unaffected.

---

## Known cosmetic gaps (coverage holds; no `error` tokens)

Closed in 1.1.0:

- **Rust macro metavariables** — `$tok:fragment` now tokenizes as
  one `ident`. ADR 0007. Was: 79 errors per macro-heavy sample.
- **TOML triple-quoted strings** — `"""…"""` and `'''…'''` are
  rules now. ADR 0008. Was: 188 errors per content-heavy file.
- **UTF-8 outside strings + C block comments** — `unicode_ident`
  default flag + a `/* … */` pair rule in `c.cyml`. ADR 0009.
  Was: 8 errors per typical vidya C sample.

Still cosmetic-only and waiting on a future ADR:

- **Char literals** (`'x'`, `'\0'`) and byte-char-with-escape
  (`b'\n'`): Rust + C still split into op/body/op triples.
  Needs a `char_literal = true` default with 2-3 char lookahead.
- **F-string prefix**: `f"..."` → `ident(f) + string("...")` in
  Python. Same for r/b/rb/fr prefixes.
- **Block comments in Rust** — Rust's `/* */` is *nestable*, so
  the simple pair rule used for C won't work. Needs a nesting
  variant. Not triggered by the canonical sample.
- **Python INDENT/DEDENT**: structural tokens Python parsers want
  aren't emitted. Not needed for the tokenizer's correctness bar.

## Past audits

- [2026-04-23 — Pre-1.0 audit](../audit/2026-04-23-audit.md):
  0 CRITICAL / 0 HIGH / 0 MEDIUM-open (one MEDIUM fixed in-pass);
  5 LOW. FINDING-006 fixed in 1.0.1. See `SECURITY.md` for the
  living state of the audit findings.

Next scheduled audit: 1.2.x closeout (after the new-language
additions land).

---

## Next up — 1.8.0 (DevOps + infrastructure)

Per the [roadmap](./roadmap.md), the next batch is
**1.8.0 — DevOps + infrastructure formats**: `dockerfile`,
`makefile`, `ini` / `.conf`. `nginx` tracked post-1.8 if demand
emerges. ADR 0006 stand-ins likely.

Surfaces to watch:
- **Dockerfile** is line-oriented with reserved instruction
  heads (`FROM`, `RUN`, `COPY`, `WORKDIR`, `ENV`, `EXPOSE`,
  `CMD`, `ENTRYPOINT`, `HEALTHCHECK`, `ARG`, `LABEL`, `USER`,
  `VOLUME`, `STOPSIGNAL`, `ONBUILD`, `SHELL`). Case-insensitive
  per spec (`FROM` and `from` both work) — same flag SQL uses
  in 1.6.0 (ADR 0011).
- **Makefile** is **tab-sensitive** — recipe lines must start
  with a tab, not spaces. Tokenization at the byte level
  doesn't care about that, but worth flagging in the grammar
  header.
- **INI / .conf** is the simplest of the three: `;` or `#`
  line comments, `[section]` headers, `key = value` lines.
  Mostly mechanical.

After 1.8.0, the roadmap continues with 1.9.0 (AGNOS-native:
`cyml` proper-grammar, `llvm-ir`), then the pre-2.0 prep
waves (1.10–1.13). 2.0.0 is the streaming-tokenizer break.

Each new grammar is a `grammars/<name>.cyml` plus a
`tests/corpus/<name>.<ext>` (vidya snapshot per
[ADR 0001](../adr/0001-corpus-sync-policy.md)) plus probe
assertions in `tests/vyakarana.tcyr`. The data-driven scanner
already covers the structural shapes; expect each addition to be
mostly grammar-file work unless a language forces a new rule
type (in which case a new ADR per the M2 scope of
[ADR 0005](../adr/0005-m2-rule-type-scope.md)).

**Out-of-scope follow-ups still on the books** (capture before
starting 1.2.0 so they don't drift away):

- Rust byte-char-literal-with-escape (`b'\n'`) — pre-existing
  gap, not addressed by ADR 0007. Likely solved with the same
  `char_literal` scanner default that the C/Rust char-literal
  gap is waiting on.
- Python f-string / r-string / b-string prefixes coalescing into
  the string token. Documented gap; defer until a corpus or a
  consumer asks for it.
- Float literals + datetime literals in TOML
  ([ADR 0008](../adr/0008-toml-triple-quoted-strings.md)
  scoped them out).

Post-1.1 roadmap ([./roadmap.md](./roadmap.md) has the detail):

- **M4** — Theme-palette contract with owl. Shared palette header
  is the likely shape.
- **M5** — Streaming tokenizer (iterator API). Memory goes
  O(tokens in flight); enables `owl huge.log`.
- **M6** — vidya reverse consumption (vidya starts rendering its
  `content/lexing_and_parsing/` samples through vyakarana).
- **M7** — Polish + release candidate.

---

## Cross-repo coordination

- **owl** (`/home/macro/Repos/owl`) — its M3b was blocked on M1
  and can now add `[deps.vyakarana]` at the tag the user cuts.
  Do **not** sidestep with a path hack.
- **vidya** (`/home/macro/Repos/vidya`) — read before making
  corpus decisions. M6 will bring vidya on as a consumer; don't
  pre-negotiate that now.
- **cyrius** (`/home/macro/Repos/cyrius`) — toolchain. Pinned at
  `5.9.36` in `cyrius.cyml`. The 2026-05-07 `include`-graph
  regression filed against 5.9.32
  ([`./issues/2026-05-07-cyrius-include-graph-regression.md`](./issues/2026-05-07-cyrius-include-graph-regression.md))
  is resolved on 5.9.36. If you find another compiler bug, file
  it upstream; don't work around it in vyakarana.
